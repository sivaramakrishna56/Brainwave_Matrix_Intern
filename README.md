# Brainwave Matrix Solutions — Project Overview
Over the past few days, as part of the Brainwave Matrix learning initiative, I developed two fully functional database-backed systems designed to simulate real-world use cases: a Library Management System and an Online Store Database. These projects reflect a hands-on approach to understanding relational database design, SQL automation, and end-to-end data workflows.

## Library Management System
The LMS was designed to handle all core operations of a modern library—such as user registration, book circulation, reservations, and fine calculation. Key learning outcomes included:

Using SQL triggers for automated fine generation on overdue books.

Designing normalized tables to manage relationships between users, books, and loans.

Implementing reservation queues and managing loan statuses.

## Online Store Database
This system simulated the backend logic of an e-commerce platform—handling everything from product listings and customer orders to payments and inventory tracking. Key highlights include:

Structuring a scalable schema with tables for customers, orders, products, and payments.

Writing advanced SQL queries for top-selling products and low inventory alerts.

Practicing order lifecycle management and payment logging.

### Takeaways from Brainwave Matrix Work
Gained practical experience designing and querying relational databases.

Learned how to think from both the developer and business perspective.

These foundational projects were crafted to be clean, modular, and ready for future integration into web or mobile platforms.
